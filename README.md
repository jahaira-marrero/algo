# Big O Notation
## Goals
1. Understand the need for something like Big O Notation
2. Describe what Big O Notation is.
3. Simplify Big O expressions.
4. Define "time complexity" and "space complexity".
5. Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different alogorithms.
6. Describe what an algorithm is.

### Summary
 - Big O Notation is used to analyze the performance of an algorithm.
 - Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
 - Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends:
    - linear?
    - quadratic?
    - constant?
- The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, NOT the hardware used to run the algorithm
